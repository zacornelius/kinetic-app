I have been purchasing your dog food along with two other individuals in the state of Utah since about September of 2023. The others have been purchasing for a while longer. As of March 2024, I have been selling enough food on a monthly basis, I have purchased a full pallet of food to keep my supplies up. On top of that, I have recently brought this food to the attention of a local dog rescue near me that said they are interested in trying the food. With the rescue on board, along with an animal food nutritionist who was the breeder of one of my dogs, my need for a consistent supply of the food is constantly growing. Right now, all of the purchasing is going through either High Definition K9 or Branden Looke, I’m not sure who it is billed under. I was wondering if there was a way, and if it would be beneficial for me, to have my own buyers account more directly through your company? Looking at your website, the option for a re-seller is being offered, but an account code is needed. For a quick background about me; I am a small business owner part time and a full time K9 officer in Utah. I’m doing my best to promote this food along both the civilIan Donovan side and LEO side of what I do.

We currently feed team dog salmon and herring and until lately have had no issues but I am noticing his fur loosing its shine , loosing fur on our legs.

I currently have him on skin and coat supplements and adding ultra oil to his diet until I have finished researching. I recently listened to your podcast going over your food and I resonated with a lot of what you all said which is why I am inquiring on which formula would you all recommend for August?

I have never had an issue with your food, or my dogs wanting to eat. They look amazing during hunting season and out of season. With that being said I recently got a bag of the puppy dog food (I order through chewy on an automated shipping system) and my 7month old German Shorthair refused to eat it. She has never been like this towards your food. She went all through the night and never ate the food from the new bag. So I mixed in the Kinetic 26% I feed my 2yr old GSP. She ate the 26% but left the puppy food. So I was curious and fed my 2yr old some of the puppy food. She didn’t hesitate and ate it with no issue. The next morning I went to the kennel and discovered that my 2yr old had thrown up all her food. I am not sure if the bag was contaminated with something or if I just got a bad bag. I am more than happy to send in a sample to be tested. I am not upset with the situation I just want you all to be aware of my current issue. Hope to hear from you soon.

This is Andrew Rollins, I was the 2nd place overall finisher with my Golden/Lab, Aspen, from this past Canine Biathlon event. 

I spoke with David Dourson about the 1 year supply provided to the top 3 finishers. I am very excited to try Kinetic. Unfortunately, the business card I got did not make it home with me. 

Aspen is a 75lb, Golden/Lab Mix that is just over 8 years old. 

His current diet is Purina Pro Plan's Salmon Based Sensitive Skin and Stomach. He's eaten this since he was about 6-8 months old. We selected this diet as a test to see if some pustules, itchiness, and semi frequent throwing up of bile were related to the chicken diet he was on. 

All of these issues appeared to resolve themselves, but it's not fully conclusive that he does have a chicken allergy (never officially tested). 

With that, it seems the Vital 24k might be the best option without further investigating how he would do with Chicken. 

I look forward to hearing back!

I am writing to introduce you to the Bradley W. Taylor K9 Memorial, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization dedicated to honoring the memory of Brad Taylor, a remarkable K9 handler for the Sandy Police Department (UT), who sadly passed away in 2023. 
In honor of Brad's legacy and commitment to serving our community, we are organizing 3 days of competitive K9 trials that will draw K9 handlers from across the state and region to compete. The trials will consist of a variety of closed events on Friday and Saturday, followed by a free public competition and exhibition on Sunday. 

These trials highlight the incredible bond between K9 officers and their handlers, the tireless training put in to achieve proficiency, and also serve as a platform to promote camaraderie and excellence in K9 training. 

To make this event a success, we are reaching out to generous individuals and organizations like yours for support. Your contribution will not only help us cover the expenses associated with organizing the trials but will also enable us to continue our mission of honoring Brad's legacy and supporting the Police K9 community. 

There are several ways you can support us: 
Financial Donations: Your financial contribution, no matter the size, will directly impact our ability to host a successful event and further our cause. 
Merchandise Donations: If you have merchandise or products that you would be willing to donate for our event, we would be incredibly grateful. 
Vendor Opportunities: We also have vendor spaces available for those interested in showcasing their products or services at the trials. 

In return for your support, we offer various sponsorship packages tailored to meet your specific needs and preferences. 

These packages include prominent recognition throughout the stages of competition, in the event materials, social media recognition, and the opportunity to showcase your brand to a diverse audience of K9 handlers, law enforcement professionals, and community members at our events and public exhibition and vendor area. 

We believe that by coming together as a community, we can create a lasting legacy in honor of Brad Taylor's memory and provide invaluable support to the K9 community. 

If you are interested in supporting our cause or would like more information about our sponsorship opportunities, please see the attached Sponsorship Outline. You can also contact me directly at 801-664-4287 or bwtk9memorial@gmail.com. Thank you for considering our request. Your generosity and support mean the world to us and the entire K9 community.

I am Matt Burgess, the CEO and Co-Founder of Freedom Fidos. I am a disabled Veteran. We rescue dogs from shelters, train them to be service dogs, and provide them for free to disabled Veterans. We have created 56 service dog teams with a waiting list of 200. I saw you all at the recent Obstacle course event in Alabama. 
I am writing to ask if you would consider being a sponsor. Ten bags of food a month would help us tremendously. I am inspired by the product you produce and the story behind it. 
If this is a win-win, I can add the Kinetic Logo and website under our list of sponsors on a trailer wrap I am doing next week, our website (www.FreedomFidos.org), all social media posts, a sponsor banner that will be at events we attend, and future merchandise. I can also provide tax receipts. 
We currently use grain-free. 
My service dog, Brinks, a national celebrity, carries a bucket at fundraising events, takes donations, and puts them in the bucket. This is a crowd favorite. I have a fantastic picture of him holding the bucket. When we created stickers with this picture and the statement, &quot; I hold for heroes,&quot; underneath, it was very popular. Maybe this is something to be considered on a dog food bag. 

I am also interested in learning more about becoming a reseller. I now receive frequent requests for dog food that I recommend. Most of our service dog handlers use the food I recommend. 
Thank you for being so considerate.

US,Ashleigh Campbell,Product Question,6315539524,ascampbell428@gmail.com,Active Dog Owner,4,"Hello, 
I am in the process of selecting a new dog food for 3 of my 4 dogs. Two of them are lab-mix rescue dogs (lab/hound and lab/beagle/hound) that are 10 and 11 years old and somewhat still active. They have always been on a high protein, grain inclusive, legume free diet. The third dog is a 2 year old chocolate lab who is very active. She currently competes in dock diving and will be starting Up Dog/Frisbee this summer. She placed 5th at the DockDogs world championships this past October in the Junior Big Air division. I have been researching the Kinetic brand on your website and it looks to be what I'm looking for. The only question I have is are your foods legume free? Also, which formulas would you recommend for my pack? I'd prefer to have them all on the same formula, but with the large age gap I understand that the chocolate lab might thrive on a different formula than the older girls.

I have a question about feeding a pup. I have a 4 month old Standard Poodle and I'm curious if I can be feeding the Active 26k formula that my other dogs are eating. I see the formula and nutrient levels are similar to the Puppy 28k but I am curious about the DHA levels. Your site says the puppy formula has elevated DHA levels, would I be doing my pup a real disservice by feeding the Active 26k formula? 
Also, I am the manager of K9 Solutions Center in New Carlisle, Ohio. We have 6 trainers on staff. I'm curious about the bulk purchase and/or the reseller program. We work with 800-900 dogs a year through our facility and I'm curious if we might not be a good fit for one of those programs.

The cost to acquire a customer can be varying depending on the channels and methods used. My goal is to save you the money you would spend in advertisements and marketing and provide additional value to our current clients. 

When clients enroll into our program we provide them with discount codes with other businesses we recommend. Primarily we have done this with gear makers. After getting texts and emails from our clients asking about treat and chew recommendations it occurred to me to do the same. 

I would love to work with you guys and if you feel this is something that you would be interested in please let me know!

I've switched to using kinetic foods (Ultra 32K) for over a month now and have noticed huge differences in my K9. He is now having better stools and not so irritable with stomach issues. For awhile I was getting concerned with the inconsistency of his stools and not having the stamina during shift or training. Since changing foods I've noticed a higher drive and longer lasting training sessions. I've also been impressed with the physique that has already changed in him by making this change. Also, a week ago I ordered the hydro 30K and been super impressed by his performance! He's drinking more water and stamina has increased even more with shorter rest times. I could not be happier with the changes I have made for him and seems to be improving his overall health. I do have a question about the food change; is it to be expected that he may be more gassy than usual? And is it a concern if he eats grass occassionally? Again, I appreciate the performance and improvements I have noticed for my K9 and the quality of products you guys provide!

My name is Tom Bruce and I’m the Lt over our agency’s K9 team and currently use Kinetic dog food for our K9s. We met one of your vendors at a K9 conference several years ago and saw how your product is great for working dogs. 

Our agency will be hosting a K9 skills competition in our city and are looking for sponsors or vendors for our event. The event is a fundraiser for our 501c3 registered non-profit Police Foundation, which raises funds to help officers and families in distress. This is our second year hosting this competition and had great success last year, drawing 20 teams, 500 spectators, and even live streamed the event on WingDing TV. 

This year, we’re broadening our event to include civilian trainers to compete which will likely double our teams competing. This competition is a great marketing opportunity for Kinetic and we’d love to have you be a part of the event.

I received two packages today from Fedex. I opened them to find two bags of the Vital 24 recipe, which we feed to one of our younger dogs. They were shipped from Phillips pet food and supply in Easton PA. The invoice has bill to your company, but shipping to me. I am just trying to figure out how two bags of food wound up here, and if there's an invoice somewhere that is for me, as i am not able to find any charges for them on my accounts.

I have two German Shorthaired Pointers (a 10 month old that weighs around 45-50lbs and a 5 year old that has a normal weight of 60lbs). Both dogs will hunt on a weekly basis starting Sept 1st all the way through March. I find that my 5 year old loses about 5-10 pounds each year and then I have to let him rest and work his weight back up slowly after a few weeks. I find that his energy, stamina, and recovery all slow down significantly after day 3 of hunting. I am trying to avoid issues with my 10 month old this fall and heard about your dog food from my co-worker and friend who works with our Sheriff's K9 unit. 

I am looking to try your food but want to know what you recommend for my pups. I do not mind buying two types of food, one for the off-season and one for the hunting season. Right now I am feeding Taste of the Wild - Pacific Stream, a fish based food since two of our rescue pups are allergic to beef and/or chicken protein. 

What do you recommend for my two active hunting dogs? We usually run less during the summer months but are still very active, but we try and get out almost every weekend between Sept 1st and Mid April. Our hunting days are usually broken up in 4 hour blocks in the morning and then in the evening. However, there are two weeks where I go to South Dakota and the hunts are a bit longer. I will also be doing a part-time guiding service this fall so I need to really keep an eye on their weight, recovery and overall health. 

Thank you for your time and I look forward to your response.

We will be attending the upcoming Desert Dog event in Scottsdale, Arizona, on October 26th and 27th. This event attracts a wide audience of military, police, dog enthusiasts and professionals from across the country.

We believe a partnership between San Diego K9 Co. and Kinetic would be mutually beneficial.

I typically used chewy to source my kinetic 26k until there was a supply issue a few months ago. I then utilized petflow, and recently tractor supply to source my kinetic 26k. I noticed on my recent order that the food had a different appearance and slightly different smell than normal. It didn’t seem foul or spoiled so I fed it. My two dogs proceeded to have diarrhea (sometimes bloody) and threw up on and off for over a week. We ultimately determined the food was the issue and stopped feeding with a different product and the issues were immediately resolved. Unfortunately i don’t have a batch number for you to look into, only an order number from Tractor supply (1165084652).",Ian Donovan,Closed,8/23/24 12:34,249663A3,,,,,,,,,,,

I noticed that the food bag smelt strange but thought it was just from Tractor Supply’s other products. I attempted feeding it to my two dogs and both refused it. I unfortunately did not save the bag. I smelt the food compared to another bag I got from Chewy and the Tractor Supply bag smelled rancid in comparison. 

I just want to make you all aware of the situation, I believe in the food and will continue using it. I personally believe that it is due to minimal sales coming from that store and rotation of food (they did not even have it on a shelf) but I don’t have any facts to back that up otherwise.",Ian Donovan,Closed,8/24/24 3:58,2A961EE5,,,,,,,,,,,

We've met you guys at a couple of conferences this year where we were both exhibitors (Pheasant Fest &amp; Police K-9). 
Two Bitch Bourbon is partnering with complimentary brands/products like yours to create more value for your company and your customers. In short, we will give a FREE $ 25 gift card to our site to all of your customers who buy from you in the month of September. No catch, no cost, no gimmick. 

You can market it as a value-add to your customers however you think is best. It could be that they receive the gift card for placing any order from you (no minimum), or you could tie it to a certain product or bundle of items. You can market it via email, social media, on your website, etc., as a limited time offer for the month of September. Both new and existing customers are eligible to receive the deal. 

Everyone wins. You get to add value for your customers to help generate sales of your products at no cost to you. Your customers get $ 25 free to spend on a complementary brand/product. And it only costs us when/if your customers redeem the gift card, and we know the cost in advance rather than paying to run expensive advertising that may or may not result in new customers. 

We’re ready to partner with you and make this opportunity as easy and successful as possible. Please let us know when would be a good time to connect via phone or video conference to discuss details and get started. 

P.S. Two Bitch Bourbon is now the official bourbon sponsor of the American Kennel Club, and September is National Bourbon Heritage Month! 

Cheers for the Love of Dogs, Bourbon &amp; Good Times!

The Southeast KG Working Dog clubs of DVG America together are hosting the 2024 DVG IGP National Championship at the National Training Center in Clermont, Florida on December 13-15. 
We will be having a raffle at the championship. Our clubs use the proceeds from the raffle to support our organization, and to help keep our beloved dog sport strong. However, this year we are including the Groveland and Clermont Police Departments’ K-9 Units as recipients of some of our raffle proceeds. They are both very small units, and we are hoping to help them grow. We are also presenting some of the raffle proceeds to the family of Master Deputy Bradley Link who was recently killed in the line of duty in Lake County Florida on August 2, 2024. 
Our clubs are reaching out to you in hopes that you would be willing to donate to our raffle. There are also other sponsorships, and vendor availabilities. We are expecting a large amount of spectator traffic at this championship which would be excellent exposure for your product. In return we will post your company logo on our event social media page, and on the event website. I have included the link to the website, which has all the other sponsorship and vendor information. Please contact me if you have any questions. I am looking forward to your response. 
Thank you. 

Warm Regards ,

About 1 year ago we were only feeding this to 1 of our working malinois. He went off food for 6 days Im a vet tech we did about $1000 worth of diagnostics and came up with nothing. We got a new bag of food and he ate immediately. 
Last week I have 5 dogs ( including a puppy ) on the food and one wouldn't eat and another ate slow and vomited for 24 hours. I threw that bag of food out and had another there so the next day used that bag. Everyone ate but everyone started vomiting after that. I threw that bag of food out and switched them to a totally different food and other than everyone having diarrhea from the switch there is no more vomiting and everyone if feeling better. I have two dogs in the house that eat a totally different food normally and they were fine with both instances of this happening so I don't thing its a &quot; bug&quot; , and they recovered as soon as I switched. I just wanted to make you guys aware of this. A suggestion I have is I know it costs more but you may want to vacuum seal your food for freshness. These bags of food are stored in a dry area in my house as well as a pallet of a different food that is vacuumed sealed . I just wanted to make you aware.

US,Dylan Hayes-Morrison,Military/LEO,352-660-4649,Hayesdm@cityofgainesville.org,Law Enforcement,4,"Good afternoon, 

My name is Dylan Hayes-Morrison and I am the sergeant of the Gainesville Police Department K9 Unit located in Florida. Our K9 teams have been using Kinetic 26K Formula dry food 35 pound bags for the past year. We have been pleased with it so far and would like to continue using it. Unfortunately, our local supplier (a store called Earthpets) advised their vendor no longer carries Kinetic and the store itself can’t order the 48 bags because our unit is their only Kinetic customer. 

The city of Gainesville has very stringent purchasing procedures. We are doing a one-time purchase to hold us over from Chewy’s using a purchase card but it’s against city policy to use the card for re-occurring purchases. The city requires we use a purchase order system but Chewy’s and other companies like Tractor Supply don’t accept PO’s. 

This leads me to my questions. Would it be possible for the City of Gainesville to establish Kinetic as a vendor and would Kinetic accept a purchase order? Does Kinetic do direct purchasing and re-occurring shipping for K9 Units? We currently have four dogs that use Kinetic. We would like to purchase approximately 8-10 bags every two months. We will be adding one to two more teams in the near future so the quantity will increase. 

Please feel free to call me at 352-660-4649 or email me back. Thank you for your time.

Had a question. So I train pets and working dogs and right now I'm using Royal Canin German Shepherd Breed kibble mostly because of the size of individual kibble because it is easier to hand feed for training purposes. It serves its purpose but I'm not thrilled with it because it tends to upset the stomachs of most dogs. I was told your company has started to make a larger size kibble for that purpose but I haven't heard or seen anything official. I figured I would come to the source and ask if it is true. 

I feed Kinetic 26K to my personal pups and I can say that I am truly impressed and satisfied with it. I found it through a seminar I participated in with the Throw Away Dogs Project in Maryland and it has done wonders for my two Dutch Shepherds.

Should Loki and I complete training in time (I think we will), I am planning to do the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) with him this year. I feed my dogs raw food, but that is not maintainable while backpacking so for Loki I am hoping to go with your food. From what I have read I am thinking of going with the Ultra and adding the Hydro and Bios supplements to make sure he is well hydrated and does not get sick. He weighs just under 50 lbs, so it says 2 cups of food (should I increase?) and 1.5 scoops of each supplements. Do you recommend both supplements? He will also get cosequin as he is on that already for agility.

She is probably between 8-10lbs now, and I have her on 1 cup of feed (per bag recommendation). I am using a kitchen half cup measuring cup for each feed and I have been feeding twice a day. 

She seems to developing like she should, and I handle her regularly so I feel her condition very often. I am curious about what you recommend on when/how much to increase the food, whether or not a kitchen measuring cup is an adequate tool, and at what point to transition over to the Active (which is what I have my adult on).

I have to order mine through chewy because there is not a local place to buy it. When I put my order in i normally order 2 bags at a time and have it auto shipped to my house every 3 weeks. Last night my husband we to open one of the new bags as we had just finished the last of the other bag. As soon as he opened it he knew something was wrong. It had a very strong ranic smell to it. He smelled what was let of the other bag and it smelled like normal dog food. I immediately reached out to chewy and explained what was going on. Their response is to ship it back to them. I went and opened the other bag after reading their response only to find that bag also has a horrible rancid smell also. I had asked them to ship me out 2 replacement bags as soon as I get these ones picked up from fedex which will not be until dec 2nd. After thinking about it this morning I asked if they could just refund me my money. I asked if they will contact you about this and they said that after they receive it back and inspect it they will. Well that didn't sit well with me and that is what brought me here now. I want you to know because if there is a bad batch out at their warehouse i don't want to be shipped 2 new bags with the same problem. before I boxed them back up today I did take pictures of both of the upc if you need them. thank you stacey critser.,Lindsey Cornelius,Closed,11/27/24 15:07,2AB35005,,,,,,,,,,,

We have been using Kinetic dog food for the last two years. We use Chewy as our supplier since we can't find it in stores near us (Dayton, Ohio).

I contacted Chewy and they immediately sent us out a new replacement bag. However the new bag also has the same odor. We have plenty of friends ( the ones who referred us to Kinetic) who use the food and they haven't said anything about their food.

Our team currently has six (6) dogs, but plan on adding at least four (4) in the near future. We have contacted at least five local dog food suppliers and/or veterinarians and none of them are able to order the Kinetic brand of dog food. Is there a vendor, in the Sacramento/Folsom area that can provide your brand? We tend to purchase 10 bags of the Active formula. One vendor had ordered it for us, but they have stopped. The last order, in September, was ordered from Chewy.com. Unfortunately, they send each bag individually. They do have a subscription option, but our purchasing policies do not allow for subscriptions so we are unable to receive the discounted subscription price. I appreciate any assistance or advice you can provide.

US,George Brandt,Product Question,7207459597,geobrandt@yahoo.com,Active Dog Owner,1,"Hello - I have a 4 year old lab who is very slender in build and weighs around 64lbs. He was neutered a year and a half ago. We hunt, but just not as often as I'd like. I do walk him at least a mile a day and often as much as 3 miles. He is exhibiting a lot of anxiety around the house, however, and is particularly sensitive to electronic noises such as text notifications on cell phones. He constantly whines and begs to go outside and then let back in. This behavior has gotten much worse in the past couple of months. 

Although I find it impossible to believe this is the only issue he has, his vet has suggested that he may be getting too much protein. I presently have him on Kinetic 26, though, and would like to ask whether you think it will make a difference to switch him to 24? 

I would greatly appreciate your reply - thank you in advance!

I'm considering your food but I need something High performance, but prefer in a fish base and I can't tell what's what. Can you give me a general breakdown of what food is what and do you offer a Marine base in a high protein and caloric option?

Both very active and healthy. I’ve always fed my dogs Science Diet -especially durning puppy and training phase. I got talked into making a switch to Victor -but my first bag the company had a product recall. And immediately went back to Science Diet. Several of our LEO K9 students fed their dogs with Kinetic -and they looked and preformed great. I would like to switch over to Kinetic myself. I’m feeding my Malinois roughly 6 cups (AM: 3 cups and PM: 3 cups). For me -that’s entirely too much food. The Dutchie is normal at roughly 3-3 1/2 cups per day. I circulate between 6 different (Adult 1-6) Science Diet Dry Kibble varieties. All protein and fat fairly similar. Average Protein is 23.87% and Fats are 15.63%. I trained LEO And service dogs for years. And we tried to feed our working dogs roughly 3 cups of dry kibble per day -give or take depending on size and conditions. But feeding my Malinios 6 plus cups a day is excessive. He looks great, but there are times I can visually see rib shadows. I know he burns it off quickly throughout the day. But I worry about the amount I’m feeding him. Would you be able to give me a recommendation on which Kinetic product I should buy. That will both meet the needs of my Dutchie and Mal? And also do you have any store products near or around the 78003 zip code (Bandera, TX) -45 miles west of San Antonio, TX. Or would I need to buy online? Thank you for your time.

US,Polina Ziuzina,Product Question,4255003601,ziuzina.polina@gmail.com,Active Dog Owner,1,"I would love to give kinetic a try, but don’t know what recipe to get. I had just listened to a podcast episode from “Farm Dog” and have found myself falling in love with the mindset, the goal and the initiative you all take in creating this dog food. I have a 2,5 yo Australian Shepherd from working lines and found myself living in a suburban area with her however that doesn’t take away from the amount of activity she gets. While she is far from being an actual working dog in a specific sense of daily herding/hunting or doing military or other K9 work, she unfortunately doesn’t fall into a “regular pet” category ether. My has at least 3 days of vigorous activity a week, that can range from doing canicross or bikejoring for multiple hours, going on a 10+ mile hike, going on a 4 mile walk down to the beach to swim in the Puget Sound waters for a few hours with breaks and going back home, tackling alongside on all hiking and backpacking trips, dock diving and etc. During the other 4 days a week she mostly has 15-30 minute retrieving and shed hunt training or doing some canine conditioning/fitness workout inside. While she does quite a lot she is still not in need of the high calorie and food intake as her littermates (for example) who are daily herding sheep on ranches + I am still a human who gets sick, gets too busy at work and may sometimes have very slow days or even a week of cutting dog's activity level down a bit. Since puppyhood she had severe inability to put weight on herself and keep enough weight during adolescence, we have tried about every kibble brand you can name which only taught us that she does horrible on most commercially made grain inclusive diets, her gut gets absolutely destroyed by almost any dog kibble (even ones advertised as “high quality”) if they include a sufficient amount of grains. Switching her to a full raw and raw/gently cooked diets didn’t do a favor to my wallet and also brought in a lot of extra consideration about thawing the food and etc. She is 35 pounds and is a pretty lean dog (19”at the shoulder for size reference) however with most dog foods she needs over 2-3 cups a day to keep up with her energy and a fast metabolism that burns through all that. While 2 cups may seem like a fair amount to some I don’t want my dog to eat a cup of food a few hours before the regular hike and then walk miles and climb elevations with full stomach and a need to poop every few hours. I try to mostly stick with feeding her bits through the day because if I just fill a bowl with a cup to a cup and a half of foods and put it down it looks like a ridiculous amount compared to even just her head size and not to mention some days she looses interest and desire to eat because it is physically hard to get that much food into her smaller body.

Is your esteemed company is interested in the dried inactive brewer's yeast powder made in China? 
That can be put into the formula of making the animal feeds and pet foods to improve the nutrition, ex, protein and vitamin B complex, etc. 
And it can improve the animal feed's and pet food's palatability and nutrition. 
If interested, please kindly let me know.

My dog has has been on your food from the breeder till present. I am a loyal customer of your Kinetics dog food since I purchased my field breed English Springer Spaniel about a year ago. I recently purchased a bag of 26K formula from Chewy and it made my dog very sick. He vomited 3 times that day. After checking the food it had a strange odor (possible chemical) I don't know. Chewy replaced the food 3 days later only to have the same smell. Chewy refunded my purchases and I replaced it with a bag of 32K Formula and returned both bags of 26K back to Chewy. I have had no problem since. Took a sample of the food to my Vet and he agreed it had a strange smell as well. Both bags had the same lot numbers; C104692-2231-08924-T01B2.",David Dourson,Closed,2/9/25 13:44,276295AF,,,,,,,,,,,

I am an avid houndsman located in the heart of the beautiful Ozark mountains in NW Arkansas. I wanted to reach out to your great company with regard of becoming a dealer of your dog food. It has become more of a struggle for me over the past 3-5 years to find a high quality dog food that is consistently the same bag by bag. I am a 5th generation houndman with a strong reputation in my local community and surrounding communities. I know hundreds of houndsmen from all over the US and compete in hunts all over the country always expanding my friendships. I would like to hear back from you on this matter and see what it’s gonna take to join the Kinetic team!

I would love to find out if you give any additional discounts to rescues that would like to consider transitioning all of their dogs to your food? We have the dogs on Purina Pro Sport 30/20 right now, and after putting my personal foster dog on the 24k, I would love to find a way for it to be an affordable option to do for the rescue. We usually have no less than 20 dogs at our facility and at least 10 in foster. 

I have fed my personal dog Spot and Tango for a long time, and honestly had not found a kibble that I found that I felt good about feeding a foster pup and it is DREAMY to train with and have dogs work for their meals.

I recently listened to a Working Dog radio podcast (from 2018) about your dog food, and I’m wondering if your 24K or 26K dog food might be appropriate for my dog. 
Some background on my dog…I have a 1.5 year old male Doberman that I have had for about 6 months. I am currently training him in obedience and personal protection. So he is by no means a ‘working dog’ in the sense of a sport or police dog. When I got him, he had been getting fed prescription Royal Canidae since the age of 5 months. At that time he had a bout of Giardia and the previous owner’s vet advised that he be fed the prescription RC (the food their clinic carries). 
I found that even on the prescription RC food he still had loose stools. My vet suggested we switch him to prescription Science Diet food. Since being on that (and I add a probiotic powder) he has been pretty good. He only has loose stools if he is fed moderate amounts of something other than the kibble (though he does seem to tolerate your Hurricane Bites…I use them as a training reward and that is the reason I thought I’d reach out to you). 
Since acquiring him,I have been working with my vet to determine the underlining cause is of his Gi issue but we don’t seem to be making much progress. 
I’d really like to find a food that he can tolerate and that has good nutritional value. I know he’s still young, but on his current food, he just doesn’t seem like he’s building muscle like he should be. His coat is usually shiny but he often has flakiness. 
Bottom line, I want my dog to be healthy and I want to find a good food that will support his health. 
I’d appreciate any feedback or suggestions you may have. 
Thank you for your time.

I have a 4.5 year old GSP - Rudy 
He has had allergy issues his whole life we have tried about 4-5 different types of food for him 
Excessive itching and eating his pads off 
We had settled on pro plan performance Sport 30-20 (my other 3 dogs ate this and all did well and lived a long time 12-5 -14 years) 
He take ½ an apoquel pill once a day + 50mg of Hydroxyzine 2x a day 
He always itches 1st thing in am and also right before bed time every day, Day time just occasionally. 

We met Ian Donovan at MN game fair last August (2024) he looked over Rudy 
And recommended we switch to Kinetic 30 K he stated that we should be able to get him off the apoquel within a month… 
That has not happened Rudy also will eat his pads off back feet at night if I don’t boot him 
Takes about 1 month for the pads to totally heal 
I use Tough pad, Musher secret when hunting him and about once a week when treading him 
He is a house dog when not hunting IE thinks he is a person wearing a dog suit… 
He is a fabulous hunter for me works his tail of and runs hard and long 
He tread mills 5-6 days a week 2 miles at a time 
We have gone months at a time with his feet looking and feeling great but If I forget the boots 1 x its not good the next morning….. 
So…. Would you have any other recommendations for me? Kinetic suplemnets ? 

I love the food he is a smaller GSP 45-49 lbs depending on the season 
We feed him 2-1/4 cups per day 
Stools are goo, formed and easy to pick up etc 

Thanks do much for your time and reading my long note 

Have a great day

All the money raised on May 17 will go to the Wisconsin Bear Hunters Association. 

The Wisconsin Bear Hunters Association works to protect the rights of all hunters in Wisconsin as well as promoting youth hunting, conservation, and sound wildlife management. We have 3,000 members. We not only support all kinds of hunting in WI, we also help in other states as well. Recently we sent money to Colorado, Utah, and Maine to help fight the anti's. When the devastating storm hit this last year we sent members and money down to help. 

On the day of the WBHA Benefit Swim hound hunters all over Wisconsin will come together and race bear dogs in the water. We run heats, males and females swim separately. We will run semi finals and then finals. We will have raffles that will raise money for the WBHA. Last year we raised $3,500. The year before we raised exactly $5,000. 

Our two raffles are a walk around raffle and a raffle table. Our walk around raffle will be an Alpha XL. We will sell 3 tickets for $20. Our other raffle is a raffle table. We have a table with random hunting supplies. Our top prizes are a TT25 collar, Tactacam cell camera, handheld 2 way radio, long range truck antennas, and more. People can buy tickets for the table for 1 - $5, 3 - $10, or 10 $20. 

We also do a kids raffle. Each kid gets 1 FREE ticket. We have kids aging from 1 - 14. We try to have prizes for all age groups. We try to have hunting prizes and toys for all age groups. We draw tickets and they pick prizes in the order they are drawn. 

If you are willing to donate we will have a thank you poster at the event, a thank you facebook ad, and a thank you in our annual yearbook that over 3,000 members will see. 

Here is the poster for our add

We are home grown and family raised with our members having a combined 40+ years of Law Enforcement experience. Our mission is to provide free, accurate, and reliable training to Police K9s, their handlers, and departments. We proudly serve municipal, county, and school district law-enforcement agencies nationwide, prioritizing honesty and integrity in all our client interactions to meet their individual needs. Our Main Mission is our Rescue2Resource Program. This program allows us to rescue the very elite dogs from shelters/rescue organizations around the country. These dogs must pass a series of tests and are vetted for the characteristics, temperaments, and genetic drives necessary to become a narcotics detection and/or tracking police K9. We also provide service and comfort dogs! The program also provides a positive solution to the abandoned and unadaptable dog pandemic in our country. We pride ourselves on being able to take the abused and mistreated and repurpose these animals into one of the most admirable members of service. Our number one priority is making communities safer and stronger by training K9s to the best of their ability. K9s in communities provide a level of comfortability between community members, youth, and law enforcement, opening the opportunity for communication across barriers.

Because of your history with our outdoor community, I would love to invite you to get involved with Coon Creek’s Intro to the Outdoors event. 
Our event will take place&nbsp;on October 11th&nbsp;at the Coon Creek Hunt Club&nbsp;from Noon to 4PM. 
This event will serve as the foundation to introduce both youth and adults to the wonderful world of the sporting community. 
Highlights of the event are as follows, 
•&nbsp;Intro to&nbsp;Archery and&nbsp;Bow&nbsp;Hunting 
•&nbsp;Intro to Sporting Clays 
•&nbsp;Intro to Upland Hunting 
•&nbsp;Bird dog showcase 
•&nbsp;Illinois DNR Education Trailer&nbsp; 
•&nbsp;Free food and beverage 
My goal is to introduce this passion that I hold so dear to future generations so that our heritage&nbsp;and the&nbsp;love of the outdoors is not lost. 
This is going to be the first of many yearly events that I am hoping to grow into something much larger that will allow me to continue to give back to the community. 
&nbsp; 
I’m currently looking for sponsors who can help us provide a few giveaways to our guests at the event. My target guests will be made up of youth, women, and men. 
As a thank-you for your generosity, I would like to list&nbsp;you as one of the contributors that will be going out with our email invite notifications along with our invitations that we will be presenting to all the local shops. 
&nbsp; 
I hope I may count on you to help make this first event a success!

My name is Stuart Moffitt. My wife has a service dog (Kekoa) that just turned 2. Kekoa is a german shepherd / blue tick coonhound that currently weighs about 58lbs. He was a foster fail that turned out to be a unicorn candidate to be a service dog for my wife. He has been on the puppy 28k since we got him. The food has been amazing. He has had good growth, perfect weight and no stomach issues at all while being on the food. Since he is no longer a &quot;puppy&quot; I am wondering what would be the best adult formula to start him on. He is not super active but does sometimes have long 10-12+ hour days. We live in Phoenix so super hot summers and pretty mild winters. I read once that higher fat contents could not be good for dogs working in high heat, I am not sure if it is true though. With those considerations I was thinking the best option would be the Active 26k, but I wanted to get your thoughts. 

Thank you so much for your efforts fueling the hardest working dogs.

My name is Dan, and I run a self-funded German Shepherd rescue where I also work as a photographer and cinematographer. I’ve spent my life working with these incredible animals, and my mission is to give them the care, structure, and attention they deserve—while capturing their stories through media. 

I recently came across your company and was genuinely impressed by what you’re offering. I’m always looking for high-quality food and supplements for my pack, and your products really stood out. 

I’d love to explore a potential partnership. Specifically, I’m interested in photographing and filming my dogs interacting with your products—whether that’s eating, training, or just being their expressive, photogenic selves. I think it could be a great visual way to showcase your brand in action. 

Do you offer any media or affiliate packs for content creators or rescue operators? I’d be glad to discuss ideas and how we can work together. 

Looking forward to hearing from you, 
Dan KekoaAlaka’i

My name is Stephanie, and I am working with the Australian Shepherd Club of New England to host a stockdog trial in Connecticut on October 10th. The trial allows handlers to show off their dogs herding skills by maneuvering livestock through various obstacles in a timed, judged setting. There are many costs associated with running stockdog trials, including (but not limited to) renting livestock, feeding livestock for the weekend, purchasing supplies, prizes, ribbons, renting trial grounds, etc. We are wondering if your company would be willing to donate any samples/coupons to our trial to add to our raffle or placement prizes? We are appreciative of anything you are willing to do for us! I have attached the link to the event, as well.

I’ve been a Chewy / Kinetic26 customer for almost 5 years. Started my first girl on it and now my second girl. So disappointed that’s the 26 Active is out of stock. Good to know that Walmart has stock - BUT - they are $10 a bag higher than Chewy. And this makes a huge difference when feeding 2 dogs - as I’m sure other owners are finding out as well. 
Let’s hope that the 26 Active is available through Chewy very soon.

I am reaching out to inquire on if your company offers discounted rates to professionals (breeders, sport handlers, licensed veterinary professionals, etc.).
